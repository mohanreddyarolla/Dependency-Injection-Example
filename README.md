# ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection Lifetimes

## Overview

In ASP.NET Core, the built-in dependency injection (DI) container supports different lifetimes for registered services. Understanding these lifetimes is crucial for designing robust and efficient applications.

This README provides an overview of the available lifetimes and their typical use cases.

## Lifetimes

### 1. Transient

- **Lifetime**: New instance is created every time it's requested.
- **Usage**:
  - Doesn't maintain any state that needs to be reused.
  - Suitable for lightweight, stateless services.
  - Use for classes where methods perform business logic without setting class properties or maintaining state.
  - Example: A service that calculates the total price of a shopping cart based on its items.

### 2. Singleton

- **Lifetime**: Single instance throughout the application's lifetime.
- **Usage**:
  - You only want one instance of this service for the entire application.
  - Suitable for services that are expensive to initialize or maintain global state.
  - Use for classes that handle tasks such as deserializing configuration files, caching data, or managing global resources.
  - Example: A class that loads application settings from a configuration file and provides access to them throughout the application.

### 3. Scoped

- **Lifetime**: Created once per scope (typically per HTTP request).
- **Usage**:
  - You want the service to live for the lifetime of a single operation or request.
  - Suitable for services that need to maintain state across multiple operations within a single request.
  - Use for components that require initialization per request and can be reused within the same request.
  - Example: A DbContext instance used to query and update database records for a specific user's shopping session.

## Choosing the Right Lifetime

When selecting the appropriate lifetime for a service, consider the following factors:

- **Concurrency**: Ensure thread safety when sharing state between multiple threads.
- **Resource Usage**: Minimize resource consumption by choosing the shortest appropriate lifetime.
- **Scalability**: Optimize performance and memory usage by minimizing unnecessary service instances.
- **Dependency Graph**: Maintain a clear understanding of the dependency graph and ensure lifetimes are compatible across dependencies.

## Conclusion

Understanding the lifetimes provided by ASP.NET Core's dependency injection container is essential for designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. By selecting the appropriate lifetime for each service, you can optimize resource usage, ensure thread safety, and maintain a clear dependency graph.
